  <p>Charlotte Bunt and Sean Meany are the creators of Toybox, a string puppet theatre which has toured schools and festivals in the Canberra region. Joan Holt-Vance, a well known local painter sadly missed having passed away in 2005, created the landscape backdrops for the plays.</p>

<p>The duo are responsible for every facet of production and are at this stage the sole performers and completely self-funded. Besides their imaginative and some say 50's style stage mechanics and handcrafted marionnettes, the duo are noted for their original music and ability to relate well to a diverse audience. Although, the shows are aimed at young children, adults remain just as transported by the power and magic of the puppet's ability to 'suspend one's disbelief'.</p>

<p>Puppetry within the context of dramatic play often breaks down audience barriers, such as preconceived notions of theatre as inaccessible or elitist 'garble' for adults or as something expected only to be seen at the movies by children, helping to encourage a theatre going public in the future.</p>

<p>Toybox endeavours to encourage the child's imagination, thought and concentration, culminating in a shared group experience. In other words, to have fun participating in a theatrical event which is a learning and uplifting experience for puppeteers and audience alike.</p>

<p>Just as the traditional fairy tale, read or told countless times over, has continued to inspire children all over the world, so the use of the traditional marionnette has been chosen to best express and reflect the unity of form these wonderful stories contain.
