    Joan Holt(married name Vance 1926-2005) learnt to draw at the Dattilo-Rubbo school of Art. Her love for colour 
    was nurtured at the age of fifteen with tuition from Grace Cossington Smith. 
    She was highly influenced by the compositions of Cezanne at an early age. 
    As a young adult she studied art in London, returning to teach in NSW schools 
    for four years. Joan always enjoyed doing portraits and landscapes as 
    well as for many years running a property with goats and other animals.Toybox 
    was very fortunate to have her paint their backdrops and audiences were always 
    delighted by them.
