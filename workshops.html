available for download <a href="parent_guardian_permission_eform.docx">here</a> and automatically available with online purchase. </p>

<p> Now for the fun part! An explanation of what goes on in our workshops. First a bit of background history..
 In the late 90's
TPT ran a once only highly successful workshop at the Narrabundah premises before it was closed down.
Parents were so impressed by the workshop they banded together to create a "friends of Toybox" group.
Children who attended the workshop utilized all their skills and went beyond expectations of
what they could achieve individually and as part of a group. By the end of the workshop they had
built their own puppets, written their own script, recorded their own music, built and painted
their own props and backdrops, rehearsed and performed their own show. It was a hit success and
everyone was very excited by the outcome. Now all these years later we are able to offer 
a similar workshop with more time to allocate during school holidays.</p>
<p> Children between the ages of 10 and 12 have been chosen for these first holiday workshops
and only a small group to ensure every child is fully involved.
Regular supervised sports and drama games will also be provided each day so children can get up and stretch
away from craft activity.</p>
<p> So if you think your child is a budding creative in everything from craft to acting, writing
and designing and would love the opportunity to flex their inventive muscles, they will certainly
accomplish it here.</p>
